# STOP!

**You cannot download the extension from this folder.**

If you want to download the Blender extension, you may do so on [**the Releases page**](https://github.com/adroitwhiz/after-effects-to-blender-export/releases).

This folder only contains source code, and the extension will not function if you try to install it from here.
